Feature: Configure openstack for light test
    Scenario: Check that we have all default packages installed, all services running. Install packages needed for tests
        Given current user can execute sudo without password
        And every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName   |
            {% for package in test_prepequisites %}
            | {{ package }} |
            {% endfor %}
            {% for package in packages_to_install %}
            | {{ package }} |
            {% endfor %}

        And every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in supplementary_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
            {% for service in openstack_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}

        When I install RPM package(s):
            | PackageName   |
            {% for package in volume_packages %}
            | {{ package }} |
            {% endfor %}
        Then every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName   |
            {% for package in volume_packages %}
            | {{ package }} |
            {% endfor %}


    Scenario: Start iscsi and nova-volumes services
        Given current user can execute sudo without password
        And every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName   |
            {% for package in volume_packages %}
            | {{ package }} |
            {% endfor %}
        When I start services:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in volume_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
        Then every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in volume_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}



    Scenario: Register pool of external IPs for FLIP test
        Given novarc is available
        When I add pool of external IP addresses "{{cc_external_network}}"
        Then I see pool of external IP addresses "{{cc_external_network}}" exist

    Scenario: Configure OpenStack for light test
        When I change flag file "{{nova.conf_file}}" by setting flag values:
            | Name                      | Value     |
            | --allow_same_net_traffic  | false     |
            | --project_uniq_names      | true      |
            | --local_images_type       | qcow      |

         Then the following flags in file "{{nova.conf_file}}" are set to:
            | Name                      | Value     |
            | --allow_same_net_traffic  | false     |
            | --project_uniq_names      | true      |
            | --local_images_type       | qcow      |


    Scenario: Restart OpenStack services
        Given every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in supplementary_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
        When I restart services:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in openstack_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
        Then every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in openstack_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}


    Scenario: Workaround for dnsmasq hang up
        I run commands:
        |  Command                            | Expected |
        |  sudo killall dnsmasq \|\| echo     |  noFail  |
        |  sudo service nova-network restart  |  noFail  |
