Feature: Delete LVM group and loop device used for tests
    Scenario: Remove created volumes
        Given every service is stopped:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in volume_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
        When I remove lvm group "{{volume.group}}" on device "{{volume.source_dev}}"
        And I remove loop device "{{volume.source_dev}}"
        Then I see lvm group "{{volume.group}}" on device "{{volume.source_dev}}" removed
        And I see loop device "{{volume.source_dev}}" removed
