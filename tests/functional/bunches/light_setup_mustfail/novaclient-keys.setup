Feature: Register SSH keys using  python-novaclient CLI
    In order to have access to VM instances
    As tester
    I want to register SSH keys via python-novaclient CLI tools


    Scenario: Register existing keypair from file
        Given novarc is available
        When I generate keypair saving it to file "{{vm.keypair.private}}"
        And I add keypair with name "{{vm.keypair.name}}" from file "{{vm.keypair.public}}"
        Then keypair with name "{{vm.keypair.name}}" exists
