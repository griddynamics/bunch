Feature: Create user and project using python-novaclient CLI
    In order to prepare environment for smoke test
    As cloud admin
    I want to create user and project

    Scenario: Create admin user
        Given every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in openstack_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
        When I create nova admin user "{{user.name}}"
        Then nova user "{{user.name}}" exists

    Scenario: Create project
        Given nova user "{{user.name}}" exists
        When I create nova project "{{project.name}}" for user "{{user.name}}"
        Then nova project "{{project.name}}" exists
        And nova user "{{user.name}}" is the manager of the nova project "{{project.name}}"
