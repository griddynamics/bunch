Feature: Add pool of external IP's
    In order to have test floating IP feature
    As tester
    I want to Add pool of external IP's using nova-manage

    Scenario: Workaround for dnsmasq hang up
        I run commands:
        |  Command                            | Expected |
        |  sudo killall dnsmasq \|\| echo     |  noFail  |
        |  sudo service nova-network restart  |  noFail  |


    Scenario: Register pool of external IPs
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        When I add pool of external IP addresses "{{cc_external_network}}"
        Then I see pool of external IP addresses "{{cc_external_network}}" exist

    Scenario: Register pool of single FlIPs
            Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
            When I add pool of external IP addresses "{{single_floating.cidr}}"
            And  I add pool of external IP addresses "{{single_floating.ip}}"
            Then I see pool of external IP addresses "{{single_floating.cidr}}" exist
            And I see pool of external IP addresses "{{single_floating.ip}}" exist
