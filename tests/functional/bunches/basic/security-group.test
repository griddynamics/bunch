Feature: Test security groups
    In order to smoke test security group functionality
    As tester
    I want to start 3 instances in different security groups. Then allow traffic between 2 of them and check that allowed and disallowed traffic works as it should.


    Scenario: Add 3 security groups, check them added.
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see security group "{{sg.name}}" does not exist
        And I see security group "{{sg2.name}}" does not exist
        And I see security group "{{sg3.name}}" does not exist
        When I add security group "{{sg.name}}"
        And I add security group "{{sg2.name}}"
        And I add security group "{{sg3.name}}"
        Then I see security group "{{sg.name}}" exist
        And I see security group "{{sg2.name}}" exist
        And I see security group "{{sg3.name}}" exist


    Scenario: Add rules for me to access instances
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see security group "{{sg.name}}" exist
        And I see security group "{{sg2.name}}" exist
        And I see security group "{{sg3.name}}" exist

        When I add rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "22" in group ""
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "22" in group "{{sg.name}}"
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "22" in group "{{sg2.name}}"
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "22" in group "{{sg3.name}}"

        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "" in group ""
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "" in group "{{sg.name}}"
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "" in group "{{sg2.name}}"
        And I add rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "" in group "{{sg3.name}}"

        Then I see rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "22" in group "" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "22" in group "{{sg.name}}" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "22" in group "{{sg2.name}}" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "22" in group "{{sg3.name}}" exist

        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "" in group "" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "" in group "{{sg.name}}" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "" in group "{{sg2.name}}" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "" in group "{{sg3.name}}" exist

    Scenario: Workaround for dnsmasq hang up
        I run commands:
        |  Command                            | Expected |
        |  sudo killall dnsmasq \|\| echo     |  noFail  |
        |  sudo service nova-network restart  |  noFail  |

    Scenario: Start instance
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And VM image "{{image.name}}" is registered
        And keypair with name "{{vm.keypair.name}}" exists
        When I start VM instance "{{vm.name}}" using image "{{image.name}}",  flavor "{{vm.flavor}}", keypair "{{vm.keypair.name}}" in security groups "{{sg.name}}"
        Then VM instance "{{vm.name}}" comes up within "{{vm.boot_timeout}}" seconds
        And VM instance "{{vm.name}}" is pingable within "{{vm.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        And I see that "ssh" port of VM instance "{{vm.name}}" is open and serves "ssh" protocol within "{{vm.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        And I can log into VM "{{vm.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm.user}}" with key "{{vm.keypair.private}}"
        And I login to VM "{{vm.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm.user}}" with key "{{vm.keypair.private}}" and run commands:
            |  Command  |   Expected  |
            |   whoami  |   root      |


    Scenario: Start 2nd instance
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And VM image "{{image.name}}" is registered
        And keypair with name "{{vm2.keypair.name}}" exists
        When I start VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" using image "{{image.name}}",  flavor "{{vm2.flavor}}", keypair "{{vm2.keypair.name}}" in security groups "{{sg2.name}}"
        Then VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" comes up within "{{vm2.boot_timeout}}" seconds
        And VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" is pingable within "{{vm2.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        And I see that "ssh" port of VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" is open and serves "ssh" protocol within "{{vm2.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        And I can log into VM "{{vm2.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm2.user}}" with key "{{vm2.keypair.private}}"
        And I login to VM "{{vm2.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm2.user}}" with key "{{vm2.keypair.private}}" and run commands:
            |  Command  |   Expected  |
            |   whoami  |   root      |


    Scenario: Start 3rd instance
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And VM image "{{image.name}}" is registered
        And keypair with name "{{vm3.keypair.name}}" exists
        When I start VM instance "{{vm3.name}}" using image "{{image.name}}",  flavor "{{vm3.flavor}}", keypair "{{vm3.keypair.name}}" in security groups "{{sg3.name}}"
        Then VM instance "{{vm3.name}}" comes up within "{{vm3.boot_timeout}}" seconds
        And VM instance "{{vm3.name}}" is pingable within "{{vm3.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        And I see that "ssh" port of VM instance "{{vm3.name}}" is open and serves "ssh" protocol within "{{vm3.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        And I can log into VM "{{vm3.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm3.user}}" with key "{{vm3.keypair.private}}"
        And I login to VM "{{vm3.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm3.user}}" with key "{{vm3.keypair.private}}" and run commands:

# Creating rules and checking traffic  ---------------


    Scenario: Add rule to allow all traffic from SG2 pass to SG3
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see security group "{{sg2.name}}" exist
        And I see security group "{{sg3.name}}" exist
        When I add rule allow from group "{{sg2.name}}", protocol "", host "" to access port "" in group "{{sg3.name}}"
        And I add rule allow from group "{{sg3.name}}", protocol "", host "" to access port "" in group "{{sg2.name}}"
        Then I see rule allow from group "{{sg2.name}}", protocol "", host "" to access port "" in group "{{sg3.name}}" exist
        And I see rule allow from group "{{sg3.name}}", protocol "", host "" to access port "" in group "{{sg2.name}}" exist

    Scenario: Login to 2nd instance and check traffic can pass to 3rd instance and cannot pass to 1st
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I can log into VM "{{vm2.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm2.user}}" with key "{{vm2.keypair.private}}"
        When I login to VM "{{vm2.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm2.user}}" with key "{{vm2.keypair.private}}" and run commands:
            |  Command                |   Expected  |
            |   ping -c3 "{{vm3.name}}" \| grep received \|awk '{print $4}'   |   3      |

        And I login to VM "{{vm2.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm2.user}}" with key "{{vm2.keypair.private}}" and run commands:
            |  Command                |   Expected  |
            |   ping -c3 "{{vm.name}}" \| grep received \|awk '{print $4}'   |   0      |



    Scenario: Login to 3rd instance and check traffic can pass to 2nd instance
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I can log into VM "{{vm3.name}}" via SSH as "{{vm3.user}}" with key "{{vm3.keypair.private}}"

            |   ping -c3 "{{vm2.name}}" \| grep received \|awk '{print $4}'   |   3      |


    Scenario: Remove rule to allow all traffic from SG2 pass to SG3
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see security group "{{sg2.name}}" exist
        And I see security group "{{sg3.name}}" exist
        When I remove rule allow from group "{{sg2.name}}", protocol "", host "{{network.cidr}}" to access port "" in group "{{sg3.name}}"
        Then I see rule allow from group "{{sg2.name}}", protocol "", host "" to access port "" in group "{{sg3.name}}" does not exist



    Scenario: Stop instances
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available

        When I stop VM instance "{{vm.name}}"
        And I stop VM instance "{{vm2.name}}"
        And I stop VM instance "{{vm3.name}}"
        Then VM instance "{{vm.name}}" is stopped within "{{vm.boot_timeout}}" seconds
        And VM instance "{{vm2.name}}" is stopped within "{{vm.boot_timeout}}" seconds
        And VM instance "{{vm3.name}}" is stopped within "{{vm.boot_timeout}}" seconds
 

    Scenario: Remove we used to access instances
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see security group "{{sg.name}}" exist
        And I see security group "{{sg2.name}}" exist
        And I see security group "{{sg3.name}}" exist
        When I remove rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "22" in group ""
        And I remove rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "" in group ""
        Then I see rule allow from group "", protocol "tcp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "22" in group "" does not exist
        And I see rule allow from group "", protocol "icmp", host "{{network.cc_cidr}}" to access port "" in group "" does not exist


    Scenario: Remove security groups
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see security group "{{sg.name}}" exist
        And I see security group "{{sg2.name}}" exist
        And I see security group "{{sg3.name}}" exist
        When I remove security group "{{sg.name}}"
        And I remove security group "{{sg2.name}}"
        And I remove security group "{{sg3.name}}"
        Then I see security group "{{sg.name}}" does not exist
        And I see security group "{{sg2.name}}" does not exist
        And I see security group "{{sg3.name}}" does not exist
