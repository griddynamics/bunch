Feature: Remove pool of external IP's
    In order to clean after test of floating IP feature
    As tester
    I want to remove pool of external IP's using nova-manage


    Scenario: De-associate IP from instance
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see address "{{floating.name}}" associated with instance "{{vm.name}}"
        When I de-associate address "{{floating.name}}" from instance "{{vm.name}}"
        Then I see address "{{floating.name}}" not associated with instance "{{vm.name}}"
        And I see address "{{floating.name}}" allocated


    Scenario: De-Allocate external IP
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see address "{{floating.name}}" allocated
        When I de-allocate address "{{floating.name}}"
        Then I see address "{{floating.name}}" not allocated


    Scenario: Stop instance
        Given VM instance "{{vm.name}}" is pingable within "{{vm.ping_deadline}}" seconds
        When I stop VM instance "{{vm.name}}"
        Then VM instance "{{vm.name}}" is stopped within "{{vm.boot_timeout}}" seconds


    Scenario: Undo system changes
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        When I run commands:
            |  Command                                                         | Expected  |
            |  sudo iptables -D OUTPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT                       | noFail    |
        Then commands are executed without errors


    Scenario: Deregister pool of external IPs
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see pool of external IP addresses "{{cc_external_network}}" exist
        When I remove pool of external IP addresses "{{cc_external_network}}"
        Then I see pool of external IP addresses "{{cc_external_network}}" does not exist


    Scenario: Deregister pool of single FlIPs
        Given novarc for project "{{project.name}}", user "{{user.name}}" is available
        And I see pool of external IP addresses "{{single_floating.cidr}}" exist
        And I see pool of external IP addresses "{{single_floating.ip}}" exist
        When I remove pool of external IP addresses "{{single_floating.cidr}}"
        And I remove pool of external IP addresses "{{single_floating.ip}}"
        Then I see pool of external IP addresses "{{single_floating.cidr}}" does not exist
        And I see pool of external IP addresses "{{single_floating.ip}}" does not exist
