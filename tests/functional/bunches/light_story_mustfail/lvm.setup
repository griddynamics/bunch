Feature: Install, start services and create virtual disk needed to test volume
    In order to test volume functionality
    As tester
    I want to install services

    Scenario: Install packages
        Given current user can execute sudo without password
        And every RPM package available:
            | PackageName   |
            {% for package in volume_packages %}
            | {{ package }} |
            {% endfor %}
        When I install RPM package(s):
            | PackageName   |
            {% for package in volume_packages %}
            | {{ package }} |
            {% endfor %}
        Then every RPM package is installed:
            | PackageName   |
            {% for package in volume_packages %}
            | {{ package }} |
            {% endfor %}

    Scenario: Create loop device and lvm group
        Given current user can execute sudo without password
        When I create loop device "{{volume.source_dev}}" in file "{{volume.source_dev_file}}" with size "{{volume.source_dev_size}}" gigabytes
        And I create lvm group "{{volume.group}}" on device "{{volume.source_dev}}"
        Then I see loop device "{{volume.source_dev}}" available
        And I see lvm group "{{volume.group}}" on device "{{volume.source_dev}}" available
