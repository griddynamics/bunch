Feature: Deconfigure openstack after light test 

    Scenario: Deregister pool of external IPs after FLIP test
        Given novarc is available
        And I see pool of external IP addresses "{{cc_external_network}}" exist
        When I remove pool of external IP addresses "{{cc_external_network}}"
        Then I see pool of external IP addresses "{{cc_external_network}}" does not exist

    Scenario: DeConfigure OpenStack compute
        When I change flag file "{{nova.conf_file}}" by removing flag values:
            | Name                      |
            | --allow_same_net_traffic  |
            | --project_uniq_names      |
            | --local_images_type       |

        Then the following flags are not in "{{nova.conf_file}}":
            | Name                      |
            | --allow_same_net_traffic  |
            | --project_uniq_names      |
            | --local_images_type       |

















    Scenario: Restart OpenStack services
        Given every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in supplementary_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
        When I restart services:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in openstack_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
        Then every service is running:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in openstack_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}


    Scenario: Stop iscsi and nova-volume services
        Given current user can execute sudo without password
        When I stop services:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in volume_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}
        Then every service is stopped:
            | ServiceName   |
            {% for service in volume_services %}
            | {{ service }} |
            {% endfor %}

    Scenario: Workaround for dnsmasq hang up
        I run commands:
        |  Command                            | Expected |
        |  sudo killall dnsmasq \|\| echo     |  noFail  |
        |  sudo service nova-network restart  |  noFail  |
