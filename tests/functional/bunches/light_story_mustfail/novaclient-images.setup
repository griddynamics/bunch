Feature: Create user and project using python-novaclient CLI
    In order to prepare environment for smoke test
    As cloud admin
    I want to register images

#    Scenario: Upload, unpack and register image from url
#        Given novarc is available
#        And VM image tarball is available at "{{image2.url}}"
#        When I download VM image tarball at "{{image2.url}}" and unpack it
##        And using glance I register VM image "{{image2.name}}" for owner "{{user.name}}" using disk "{{image2.disk}}", ram "{{image2.ram}}", kernel "{{image2.kernel}}"
#        And using nova-manage I register VM image "{{image2.name}}" for owner "{{user.name}}" using disk "{{image2.disk}}", ram "{{image2.ram}}", kernel "{{image2.kernel}}"
#        Then VM image "{{image2.name}}" is registered

    Scenario: Upload and register solid images
        Given novarc is available
        And VM image tarball is available at "{{image.url}}"
        When I download VM image tarball at "{{image.url}}"
#        And using nova-manage I register VM image "{{image.name}}" for owner "{{user.name}}" using disk "{{image.disk}}"
        And using glance I register VM image "{{image.name}}" for owner "{{user.name}}" using disk "{{image.disk}}"
        Then VM image "{{image.name}}" is registered
